I'm a computer science student with a focus on machine learning and systems programming. I love building things that solve real problems.

<br>

### What I Do

I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of computational linguistics, NLP and machine learning. Outside of classes, I enjoy exploring research problems from the bottom-up in ML and NLP, working on full-stack development projects and understanding algorithms and computer systems.

### Currently

I am a second-year B-Tech student at IIIT Hyderabad, pursuing a Dual Degree in Computer Science and Computational Linguistics.
